<p>Kollaborator Module Builder is a Burp Suite extension that empowers you to write your own Python script to handle collaborator interactions. </p>

<p>The beauty of this tool is it will automatically add the interaction data to the script wherever the placeholder for data is written.</p>

<p>You can write your Python script in the text area under the KMB tab. This script will be triggered once an interaction is received by the Collaborator.</p>
